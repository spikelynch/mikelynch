The Algorithm

An algorithm is a procedure or formula for calculating a result, an idea which predates the invention of the computer by serveral centuries.  It echoes the list of imperative terminology at the start of this essay - command, execution, statement - but without the master-slave relationship which seems to hide behind those. An algorithm is a recipe, not a list of commands: it is exploratory, rather than decisive.

The classic geek misunderstanding of how law works is based on a confusion between what the statements making up a computer program do - in theory, together with any inputs, and deliberately non-deterministic factors such as random numbers, they wholly determine the behaviour of the machine - and what laws do. The law of the land does not determine the actions of every person within a territory: in social terms, all law is about edge cases, defining which acts are not permitted by the state (criminal law) and providing means of redress and resolution in cases where the social relations between people breaks down (civil law). It's interesting to consider where an analogy of the algorithm falls on this spectrum: the algorithm does not say, thou shalt not do this (the law), nor does it say thou must do this (the voice of the master) but rather, if you want an answer to this question, follow these steps.

The algorithm has become a dominant way in which the general public understands computers at the historical moment when AI is really starting to be a significant factor in our lives. This moment probably started with the launch of Google, but really got going with the widespread use of algorithms to predict our likes and dislikes on services such as Amazon or iTunes, and has become a significant factor in economics, considering the importance of high-speed trading to "flash crashes" and the global financial crisis. Significantly, an algorithm is not a person.

The imaginary is a huge factor in how people conceptualise AI: it's fair to say that in no other field have fantasies played such an important part in generating our ideas. We talk, half-seriously, about "robots taking our jobs", as if robots were not modern myth-figures, with roughly the same sort of value and relationship to reality as vampires, werewolves and Frankensteins' monster: the Robot is an emblem of the slave in revolt, or what human nature would be like with all emotions drained out, or the Pinocchio-like figure of an autistic, benign personality who yearns to become a real boy. This mythology aside, people hold extraordinarily strong beliefs as to whether "strong AI" is or is not possible ("strong AI" is generally taken to mean the possibility of a sentient artifical consciousness with human-level or higher intelligence) in the absence of very much empirical evidence either way.  As a teenager, I was one of those on the "yes" side of the debate, with a passion that I can recall perfectly well but the intensity of which I find a bit bewildering. Now, my answer to the question of whether strong AI is possible is: I don't know, and I don't see any reason to suspect that anyone else knows, either.

The robot-person is recognisable as a form of our homunculus: essentially, an artificial slave. With the advent of the algorithm as a way of understanding how computers are being used to shape our lives and economy, it could be that we are beginning to leave this model behind. The term "homunculus" comes from alchemy, one of the goals of which was the creation of an obedient para-human servant, like Ariel in The Tempest. Alchemy, generally derided now, was the forerunner of, and shares the etymology of, modern chemistry. It may be that we can no more foretell the eventual outcome of artifical intelligence from our dreams or nightmares of robots, than a person of the 16th century could anticipate modern industrial chemistry from the dreams of the homunculus or the philosophers' stone.

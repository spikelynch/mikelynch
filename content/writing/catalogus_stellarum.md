I love the proper names of stars, most of which are severely corrupted versions of Arabic originals, and one of my favourite books is R H Allen's [Star Names - Their Lore and Meaning](https://archive.org/details/starnamesandthe00allegoog).

A few years ago I spent several months tweeting every star with a proper name, from Acamar to Zubeneschelmani, on my sadly undersubscribed weird twitter account [FSVO](https://twitter.com/FSVO).

Then I wrote some code to pull their coordinates from Wikipedia, and used the Javascript data visualisation library [d3](http://d3js.org/) to render them as an interactive celestial sphere.

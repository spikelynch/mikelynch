I wrote a bluffer's guide to Matthew Barney's insane five-part epic art film after seeing it at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. It's so old that it used to live on my staff home page, back when staff could have home pages: then it fell off the net, got resurrected on GitHub,  and now it's here.

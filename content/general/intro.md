I finally got around to getting a domain name.  Hi, grab a feed, make yourself comfortable.

This site is a place for me to host or link to various projects which have been either scattered around the net, or languishing in a folder on my laptop for want of a good home.

It's also an attempt to connect my day job, as a developer and analyst supporting research IT at the University of Technology Sydney, with the
writing, coding and study I do in my spare time.

Over the next few weeks so I'll be bringing more of my scattered content over
here or linking to from here: follow this blog if you want to keep up.

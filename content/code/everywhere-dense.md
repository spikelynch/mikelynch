Title: Everywhere Dense
Tags: generated, writing, Haskell

"Everywhere Dense is a novel generated by the principle of recursive acronym expansion, in which this sentence is repeatedly interpolated with random words."

[NaNoGenMo, or National Novel Generation Month](http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/25/7276157/nanogenmo-robot-author-novel) is a fun parody of National Novel Writing Month (which I also tried one year, but more on that later).  [Everywhere Dense](http://spikelynch.github.io/EverywhereDense/everywhere.dense.pdf) was my entry for 2014: a nonsensical text generated by repeatedly expanding the sentence above as acronyms. The source code is some [not especially elegant Haskell.](https://github.com/spikelynch/EverywhereDense)

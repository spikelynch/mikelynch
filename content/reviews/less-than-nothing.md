_Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism_
London: Verso Books, 2012

**Slavoj Žižek**

I've had problems with depression for my whole adult life: I am much
better at managing it than when I was younger, but one of the bad
habits which I find it hard to shake off is the tendency to burrow my
way through long, difficult and bleak works of fiction or non-fiction
when my mood is already low. The worst of these was Roberto Bolaño's
_2666_, which I really do not recommend to anyone of a melancholic
temperament.

There's something about the asceticism of hauling through a long slab
of philosophy or fiction which I don't really grasp, and which,
inasmuch as I do understand it, is basically lacking in any
concessions to compassion or comfort, which appeals to me at such
times. It's not that I agree with it, or that I find it
sympathetic. Partly it's just distraction (reading works of this order
feels like doing a large and interminable crossword puzzle) and
partly, I suspect, it's a way of seeing what my own negative mood
looks like when raised to the level of a philosophical system.

The older I get, the more such works seem to me to be symptoms, the
outgrowth of the rare combination in a single individual of deep
pessimism and the productivity required to write books of such scope
in the first place. This might be a sign that I'm leaving them behind,
which I think would be a healthy development.

I'm not able to review _Less Than Nothing_ in a deep sense,
because another side-effect of this sort of sadreading is that the
texts concerned don't leave a deep trace on my memory even when I can
understand them, but I will say that ebooks make this kind of reading
material treacherous: if I had know when Verso had it on sale that it
was about as long as _War and Peace_ I would have tried reading that,
instead. At least with _2666_, which I bought in a handsome
three-volume set, I knew I was in for the long haul.

Some pointillist impressions of _Less Than Nothing_: it's extremely
amusing to me that Žižek has a go at Douglas Hofstadter's theories of
mind: this is like a comic apposition of the geek and critical-theory
poles of my own brain.  It's also endearing that he loves Chesterton
so much. Does Lacanian analysis exist as a clinical practice, in
addition to being one of the tools in the culture theory aresenal?
Like, are there French people (they'd have to be French) who go around
saying that their marriage was saved because they realised that il n'y
a pas de rapport sexuelle? Has anyone every written an analysis of
"the psychotic" and "the neurotic" as fictional characters in
post-Freudian theory, seeing as how in Žižek at least they are not at
all clinical terms but shorthands for particular metaphysical or
philosophical standpoints?

Anyway, the book did convince me to try and revisit Hegel for the
first time since I was an undergraduate, if only so that I don't have
to rely on Slavoj's account of him. The only thing I really remembered
from that time (apart from his forming the dialectical background to
Marxism) is that Hegel was the philosopher who proved from purely
idealist grounds that there could be only seven planets in the Solar
System; as this observation was generally made by Anglo-Saxon
philosophers of science, it was usually accompanied by derisive
laughter at the fate of idealism, since the eight planet, Neptune, was
soon to be discovered.

This is all good fun, except that it isn't true.  Hegel is usually
caricatured as saying that if the facts disagree with his theory, then
"so much the worse for the facts"; what he actually says is a
commentary on
[Bode's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titius%E2%80%93Bode_law),
the early modern theory that the distances between the planets fall
into a basic arithmetical sequence. In 1801, when Hegel published his
dissertation _De orbitis planetarum_, eight planets were known to
scientists, and their orbits were in accordance with Bode's law, with
a gap between Mars and Jupiter.  At the time, astronomers were
searching for the 'missing' planet: Hegel was making the point that if
astronomers were happy with mere empiricism, they would not allow
their faith in an abstract order to drive their search for the planet in
the gap, a search which eventually led to the discovery of Ceres and
the other planetesimals in the asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter.  (A more detailed explanation of this, with a translation of
the relevant passage, can be found in [Craig and Hoskin's note on Hegel
and the seven planets](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1992JHA....23..208C/0000208.000.html))

All of which makes this aside by Žižek in _Less Than Nothing_ even
more unintentionally funny:

> ...the anecdote that he deduced the necessity of eight planets around
> the sun, not knowing that astronomers had already discovered the ninth
> (Neptune). (The irony here is that, a decade or so ago, astronomers
> re-categorized Neptune as a satellite, no longer as a planet—so, in
> fact, Hegel was right)

Is he deadpanning, or is this the natural conclusion of a
"materialism" which is so far detached from empiricism that it doesn't
care about the difference between Neptune and Pluto?

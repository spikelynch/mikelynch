[FSVO](https://twitter.com/FSVO) is a Twitter account I started in 2010 because I was surprised that no-one had grabbed the nickname, and then had to think up some use for. This turned out to be long sequences of mock-erudite sort-of-jokes mostly on scientific or philosophical subjects.  As I work my way through publishing them in various forms, I'll collect the links here.

* [Catalogus Stellarum](http://stellarum.mikelynch.org) - a guide to every star with a proper name.

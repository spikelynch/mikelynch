![Mike]({filename}/images/mike.jpg)

I'm Mike.  I'm a developer and analyst for the [eResearch Support Group](https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/)
at the Unversity of Technology Sydney, and I also write stories,
articles and hard-to-categorise web things.

This site is a place where I'll be linking to or hosting my various projects, and blog about technical and work-related subjects.

Things I'm interested in:

* functional programming, especially Haskell
* programming in general
* open data and open access research
* pretending to understand category theory
* web development, especially visualisations with d3.js
* experimental writing (fiction and non-fiction)
* music
* literature
* science
* philosophy and theory
* stupid jokes on social media
* architecture, especially Sydney's
